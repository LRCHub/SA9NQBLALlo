Oooooh, baby, yeah
Lookin' back over the years
I guess I've shed some tears.
I told myself time and time again
This time I'm gonna win.
But another fight, things ain't right.
I'm loosing again.
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again.
I think I better let it go, oh baby
It's like another love TKO.
Said I think I better let it go, oh baby
It's like another love TKO.
I tried to take control of the love.
Love took control of me.
Cause you lose all thought and sense of time.
And have a change of mind.
Takin' the bumps and the bruises
And all the pain of a two-time loser.
See I try to hold on, my faith is gone.
It's just another sad song.
I think I better let it go, oh baby
It's like another love TKO.
One more time now,
Said I think I better let it go, oh baby
Looks like another love TKO
Think I better let it go, oh baby
Looks like another love TKO X 4

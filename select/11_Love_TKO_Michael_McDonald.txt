Ooh yeah, no, no, hey now, hey there

Lookin' back over the years
You know I've shed some tears
Told myself time and again
This time I'm gonna win

But another fight, things ain't right
I'm losin' again
It takes a fool to lose twice
Start all over again

Think I'd better let it go, yeah baby
Looks like another love T.K.O., oh baby
I think I better let it go, ooh, I won't
Looks like another love T.K.O.

Tried to take control of love
Love took control of me
'Cause you lose all thoughts of sense, of time
And it'll change your mind

Takin' the bumps and the bruises
Of a two time loser
Tryna, tryna hold on, the faith is gone
Just another sad song

Think I better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.
I think I better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.

Think I better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.
I think I better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.

Tried to take control of love
Love took control of me
'Cause you lose all thoughts, sense of time
And you change your mind

Takin' all bumps and bruises
Two time loser
I'm tryin' to hold on, faith is gone
Just another sad song

Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.
Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.

Think I better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.
Think I better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.

Think I better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.
Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.

Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.
Think I better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.
